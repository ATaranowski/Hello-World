<body>I am Alex Taranowski, a psychology major completing my Senior year at Dominican University I am hoping to eventually find a business opportunity in which I can assist in psychology research and experimentation. Until then, I am hoping to broaden my horizons and see the full extent as to where my bachelor's degree in psychology will be able to take me. I hope to work toward a master's or even a PHD in the future.</body>
