<body><h2>Dear BBDO</h2></body>
<body><h2>Hello there, my name is Alex Taranowski, and I am a college senior applying for a summer internship. Your program came to my attention because of its focus on market research and consumer insights. I feel that my research background and experience would make me  a good candidate. In addition, I have also taken courses in graphic design and creative writing which have added useful skills.</h2></body>
<body><h2>As a psychology major, I have been interested in how people think. This led me to perform very well in my classes in behavioral research and statistics, so well that I participated in the Scholarship & Ideas Expo (or SI Expo). I presented findings about a survey that correlated self-compassion with happiness. I have also performed well in mathematics; in the early grades I was identified for Gifted and Talented enrichment. One or two of my high school teachers remarked on my skill in the subject. Since I studied math all during high school, including my remote online Senior year, my placement test scores met the college math requirement so I could begin with Pre-Calculus.</h2></body>
<body><h2>With these combined skills, I believe I meet every qualification required for this internship. I’m good with numbers, analytics, and psychology, all of which the advertisement recommends. Learning why people buy what they do is just another way of learning how individuals think. I hope you will consider my application for your summer internship.</h2></body></main>
